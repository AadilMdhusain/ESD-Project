Project work for Enterprise Software Development.

Task: To create a salary disbursement system which allows the employees to disburse the salary of a single faculty or a selection of faculties.

We have used JWT(JSON Web Token) Tokens for the purpose of authentication and logging in to the system. We have used springboot for the backend of our project and react for the frontend of our project.
